Open the .tex file in your favourite (plain-) text editor and have fun with this template!

To generate the .pdf, you will need to have LaTeX installed.
Get it from http://www.latex-project.org/ftp.html and also get apacite which is available either 
in the LaTeX bundle or from http://ctan.org/tex-archive/biblio/bibtex/contrib/apacite/

For a myriad of TeX related information and further downloads 
refer to http://www.tug.org and http://www.ctan.org/
